When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you need to share your work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	In case you don't want to make a current part of the project on your computer at the moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is like a clone on github. Fork is used when the original creator doesn't want anyone to mess with his work, but you could still use it and expand on it privately.

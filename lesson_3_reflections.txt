When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you need to share your work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	In case you don't want to make a current part of the project on your computer at the moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is like a clone on github. Fork is used when the original creator doesn't want anyone to mess with his work, but you could still use it and expand on it privately. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So you can check what's been changed even if offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Simple file sharing would be harder. Easier would be some sort of system without the command line and a GUI instead.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	On a separate branch means you can check with others before making a change into the master branch. However, this does make it more complicated to keep things separate and merging a lot.

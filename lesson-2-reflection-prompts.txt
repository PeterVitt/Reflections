What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git folder is created which will allow the creation of commits later on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is an intermediate stage. Nothing you do to it will create any permanent changes so you have a backup. Also, you can choose which files to commit so you can control that only one logical change is being committed at one time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By using 'get diff' with no arguments to check that your current files only have one file with a difference. Using 'git diff --staged' will ensure that your staged files and the latest commit only have one difference.

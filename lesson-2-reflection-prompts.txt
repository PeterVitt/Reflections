What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git folder is created which will allow the creation of commits later on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is an intermediate stage. Nothing you do to it will create any permanent changes so you have a backup. Also, you can choose which files to commit so you can control that only one logical change is being committed at one time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By using 'get diff' with no arguments to check that your current files only have one file with a difference. Using 'git diff --staged' will ensure that your staged files and the latest commit only have one difference.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When you're making an experimental version. It would help when there are some changes you think might not be in the final version but you want to try out. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	It is easier to visualise it since it is sort of mimicking a real life "branch".

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	It puts the changes from both into one. It comes together like in the diagram because both become parents so all the commits from both branches are included in the log.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
